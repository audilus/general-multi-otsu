# general-multi-otsu
A recursive multi-otsu implementation for OpenCV.
Number of classes is arbitrary, but performance degrades exponentially at higher classes and higher resolution images. 
This was written for an assignment initially and performance / accuracy was never the goal, but I figured I'd throw it up here since I would have wanted something similar as reference while researching how to implement Multi-Otsu.
